  This annotated Docassemble interview shows how to use the text messaging / Twilio integration
  offered by Docassemble.

  For more information on using text messages, see https://docassemble.org/docs/functions.html#send_sms

  It includes examples of using scheduled tasks and basic date math, as well as using the Individual object.

  The objects block allows you to make use of object-oriented classes. This is a very powerful feature
  but you can get by with just a little understanding of it.
  See: https://docassemble.org/docs/objects.html and https://www.nonprofittechy.com/2018/09/12/object-oriented-programming-for-document-assembly-developers/
objects:
  - client: Individual # Creates a new variable named client, which is an instance of an Individual object

  It's a good idea, but not required, to control the order of questions in your interview
  with a single mandatory code block like this one.

  Just list the variables that you want Docassemble to find, in order. If a screen defines more than
  one variable you only need to list one variable from that screen.
  See: https://docassemble.org/docs/logic.html#order

  You can also include Python code here but usually should only use "if" statements that control interview flow.
  See: https://github.com/GBLS/docassemble-workinggroup/blob/master/Skillshares/2.%20adding%20in%20logic/basic_logic.md

  - Last name: client.name.last

  Notice that objects include sub-variables (attributes). You access them with "dot" notation. client.name is itself an object

  Take a look at your Summary Process Summons and Complaint.

  Because ${answer_date} already happened, it's too late to postpone your court date.

  You should go to court on the original day, ${original_court_date}. We'll still send you a reminder.

  What is your phone number?
subquestion: |
  If you give us your phone number below, we will send you a reminder the day before court.

  cron_daily is a special event that will run once a day even if the user isn't logged in. It comes from the Unix cron utility
  which runs scheduled tasks. Scheduled tasks can only run on interviews that aren't encrypted.
  See: https://docassemble.org/docs/background.html#scheduled
event: cron_daily
code: |
  # Date comparison includes time, so we use a fuzzy comparison.
  if task_not_yet_performed("scheduled text") and today() < new_court_date.plus(days=1) and today() > new_court_date.plus(days=-1):
    # Individual objects are pretty handy. send_sms knows to check the .phone_number attribute to send a text message
    # We could have also just specified the phone number directly
    send_sms(to=client,template=scheduled_text_template, event="scheduled text")
