  This interview demonstrates how Docassemble can leverage Python's rich library
  of visualization and data functions. Here we use it to create a simple area 
  chart from a CSV file, but the basic structure would work for any more complex
  visualizations, using data from a source of your choice (such as an API, or 
  gathered in a Docassemble list).

  # The example below is mostly not Docassemble code, but standard Python code.
  # It demonstrates how you can leverage existing Python libraries to do complex
  # tasks such as data visualization.

  import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
  plt.close() # Remove any existing plots from memory
  
  # Get a Docassemble-compatible file path for our image
  visualization_image.initialize(filename="plot.png")  
  
  # Load the CSV file into a pandas "DataFrame" object.
  # See: https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/getting_started/dsintro.html
  
  # The CSV file comes from Google Trends
  # We could use a local file saved in the data/sources folder...
  # path = path_and_mimetype('data/sources/vampires_vs_zombies.csv')[0]
  
  # Or use a CSV file "published to the web" from Google Sheets as a CSV
  path = path_and_mimetype('https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/e/2PACX-1vSbfGU1lxEJ1NeaJf-1XWmjNK2DTHqse-5nLavPAYLvMaLvyinllnrCFyreTVOy-5QIh0Lp__grMiHv/pub?gid=341301610&single=true&output=csv')[0]
  
  df = pandas.read_csv(path)
  
  ax=df.plot(kind='area',x='Month',y='Zombies')
  df.plot(kind='area',x='Month',y='Vampires',ax=ax) # share the same axes
  plt.legend()
  
  # Use the file path we created above to store the completed figure
  plt.savefig(visualization_image.path())

  We specify width so we can show a larger image than the Docassemble default.
